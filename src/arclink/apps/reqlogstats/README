reqlogstats EIDA log statistics
===============================

Collects reports sent by mail to GEOFON.
Processes them.
Displays summary reports on a web page.

Requirements:
 - SQLite3
 - PHP
 - an ounce of good luck

To install on a web server:
 * set up back-end scripts where they can handle mail, should not be servable by web server
 * copy summary report PHP to a servable directory and make sure PHP can run there
 * add a crontab entry to run reqlogstats.sh each day

The ./install.sh script provided here may help you.

Adding a new node
-----------------

Try the following, once you have e-mail from the node operator:
 - DON'T run reqlogstats.sh (or reqlogstats_mail.sh)
 - cd reqlogstats; ./split_mail.sh
 - find $HOME/eida_stats -type f -mtime -1 -name "msg*"   # Identify just the valid messages you want to include in the db.
 - echo {valid file names only} | python reqlogstats.py
 - Adjust the database so the new source (e-mail address) is assigned a DCID:

	sqlite3 ~/reqlogstats/var/reqlogstats-2015.db
	select * from ArcStatsSource;
	update ArcStatsSource set dcid = "KOERI" where dcid="comoglu@boun.edu.tr";
	.quit

 - Now on the web page the node should be listed by DCID, not e-mail address
	http://eida.gfz-potsdam.de/eida/reqlogstats/

 - Add the new node in t2.py: it must produce an extra column in the table. Now check graphs are produced correctly...

 - Alter make_month_graph.sh: adjust the gnuplot commands to colour the new node; check the colours are still assigned correctly.
